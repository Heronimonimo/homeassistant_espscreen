// The screensaver (firmware 0.29.0+, app 0.4.48): where its words go. Pure arithmetic, free of LVGL and ESPHome, so
// tests/test_saver_view.cpp checks every board's glass on a PC; runtime_tiles.h draws it.
//
// ESP Screen Manager decides what the screensaver shows (screen_manager/app/screen_saver.py) and the screen shows it
// when Auto standby dims it, instead of the dimmed tiles. A camera or a cover is one picture over the whole glass that
// the app made for it (camera_feed.encode_saver): a camera fills the glass; a cover fills it while the glass is about
// square, and on longer glass takes the full height at the left or the full width at the top, the rest in the cover's
// own colour. The whole picture is a little darker, so the few words over it read. The clock is the time with the date.
// A touch wakes the screen, as it always did in standby, except on a player's three keys (firmware 0.33.0+): play or
// pause and the volume work from the screensaver, and the screen stays in standby.
