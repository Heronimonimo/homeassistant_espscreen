"""Compile caches GitHub makes ahead (app 0.4.49): a screen's first build skips most of the compiling.

Every board's firmware is the same code for everyone but a few lines (name, keys, Wi-Fi, language), and those few
sit in main.cpp. GitHub (.github/workflows/build-cache.yml, tools/build_cache.py) builds every board each night and
on every release with this app's own image and paths, and publishes each board's ccache as an asset of the release
`build-cache`. Before a build the app fetches its board's cache once, unpacks it into its own (Firmware.build_env)
and builds as it always did: ccache only answers a compile it has the exact inputs for, so a stale or wrong cache
costs time and never makes different firmware. A board without a cache, a cache of another ESPHome, no network or a
download over TIME_LIMIT: the build simply runs without it, as before.
